CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnav2_map_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nav2_map_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nav2_map_server"
  with any of the following names:

    nav2_map_serverConfig.cmake
    nav2_map_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nav2_map_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "nav2_map_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "nav2_map_server" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
