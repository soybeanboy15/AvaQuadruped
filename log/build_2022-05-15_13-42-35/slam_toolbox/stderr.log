CMake Warning (dev) at C:/opt/ros/foxy/x64/Lib/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:273 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (CSPARSE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (CSparse).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMake/FindCSparse.cmake:24 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:77 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
