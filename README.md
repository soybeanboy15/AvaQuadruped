# Quadruped Ava v2

This is version 2 of my quadruped robot Ava. The changes from v1:
- Improved mechanical design, lighter and leg design more robust.
- Implementation of LiDAR sensor for SLAM.
- All software is now implemented in ROS2

**For more information about this project please view the wiki tab!**

# Ros2 Demo

This gif capture shows a representation of Ava in RVIZ and showing real time lidar data. Note that the physical robot is not moving while moving the rviz model so the position of ava relative to the lidar data is not valid.
